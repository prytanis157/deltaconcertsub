Concert Subtitles README

This is a project I started originally for personal use.  I looked at the works
of the FanSub community and thought: "In the internet age, How much work could
this be?"  It turns out I was a fool and the answer is A LOT OF WORK.

The series Macross Delta and the Macross Wiki have a vast, but incomplete, set 
of translations for the songs and they were extremely helpful.  Without them, 
this project would never have started.

Please feel free to use this for your own entertainment.  But, if you could, 
please contribute in some way.  Your contribution could be as simple as
cleaning up some of the subtitle timing or as extensive as translating MC
sessions.  Anything helps.

Translation Notes:

Almost all of the work here is derivative from the translation work of others.
All work is credited where appropriate.  Please note that these subtitle 
credits often refer to where I obtained the translation.  If you are the actual
originator of said translation, please contact me.

Hopefully, over time, more original work will be integrated to produce a better
experience.

What makes translating songs is how artistic they are in nature.  Translation
is already, in of itself, an art, as literal translations often don't convey
the underlying meaning, including cultural subtexts.  This is made more
difficult in that songs often aren't meant to be taken literally but have a
different or deeper meaning than the sum of the spoken works.  This means that
interpretations of the same song can vary widely between translators.  Here,
all I can say is I did the best I could with the sources availabe.  My Japanese
is very poor so many of my decisions, when I made any, were based on the
context of the stanza and what other translators had already done.  But we can
do better.

Style guide:

I have tried to be as consistant as possible with my styling.  I have failed in
some places because of the sheer volume of work to get through.

1. When possible, sync the "Style" (mainly color) to the speaker/singer.
2. When two or more are singing the same thing as equals, use "Everyone".
3. If you can't tell who is singing or speaking, use "Everyone".
4. When two or more are singing but one is clearly the lead and other's are
   providing harmony, use the lead's Style.
5. During a song, if someone addresses the crowd, use italics.
5. Rules 1-3 also apply for the MC sessions.  However, don't use italics.  
6. Use the Aegisub Styles Manager if new styles need to be added.
7. Where possible, use Styles instead of trying to manually format individual
   subtitles.  
8. The song beginnings hava a header and credit field.  Please make sure 
   they are used appropriately.

FAQ

Is this subtitle file complete?

NO.  It has huge gaps, mostly MC sessions.  I still find it helpful.  You may
not.

Is this subtitle file an accurate translation of the content?

IT VARIES.  Some parts are better, some are pretty bad.  Hopefully we can get 
rid of the bad.

Will you subtitle XYZ next?

Short answer, no.
Long answer.  I admit, I never truly appreciated the amount of hard work the
FanSub commuinity does to get the shows and movies we love translated into
English.  This project has given me a peek into how much the members of the
comminity must go through.  My work is, for the most part, derivitave, while 
their's is original.  It has been a huge effort just to get this far on this project.

That all said, I'll likely move on to other Walkure concerts once this one is
nearing completion.  They should be easier as, for technical reasons, the
timing of each song matches up almost exactly between concerts.
  

Why are you using GitHub?

Version control, pure and simple.  It provides a single place to merge changes
and make a better product.  I'm perfectly fine if I'm the only person pushing
updates but would love it if other's contribute.

I want to help but don't speak any Japanese.  What can I do?

There is a lot of cleanup work to be done.  This includes doing a better job of
lining up the subtitle to what's being spoken.  If you need specific guidence,
let me know.

So, I can just work on whatever I want?

Yup.  While I'm the final arbitor of what gets merged and what doesn't, nothing
is off limits.
